    "description": "A random 3D pipe labyrinth generator. Constructed with watertight fitted mesh objects (cylinder pipes and elbow joints) with no exposed back faces. Pipes grow until a dead end, at which a new pipe of a different color begins to generate at a free point. Includes user interface for maze length, width, height, and tortuosity. Code available upon request. ",
