    "description": "Rendering synthetic objects into real world scenes is an important application of computer graphics. Examples include visual effects in movies and films, in interior design, architecture, and AR applications. To render synthetic objects realistically into a scene, we need geometry and lighting information, which are currently unconstrained problems. Currently available techniques for realistically rendering synthetic objects into scenes are expensive, time-consuming, and labor-intensive. \n Synthesis is a complete system for realistically inserting synthetic objects into existing photographs without requiring access to the scene, special equipment, multiple photographs, time lapses, or any other aids. The system allows users to upload an image into the window. User annotations from our easy-to-navigate UI is used to model geometry and estimate illumination. Material in the original scene is assumed to be lambertian, and the virtual object has its own specified material properties. We render the final image using Debevecâ€™s rendering technique. The end product is the original photograph with a realistic virtual image object incorporated into the scene.",
