	  Hey there! I'm Betty, a coffee-sipper and senior studying Computer Science and English at Brown University. I'm passionate about exploring the connections between users and the worlds that technology can create for them: specifically in <a><strong>virtual reality, computer graphics, and front-end development</strong></a>. I'm interested in learning more about visual computing and the developing fields of virtual and augmented reality.

	  This past summer, I interned at Google with the Play Music team. I implemented entity search suggestions for Music Search, enabling users to play songs and albums directly from the search bar. I've also worked with the Brown Pen and Touch Computing Graphics Lab, where we are building a collaborative workspace application that explores the myriad possibilities in the intersection of pen and touch technology, smart desktops, spatial hypermedia systems, and small group collaboration. Currently, I'm taking a pretty cool graduate-level graphics class where we read and analyze a variety of SIGGRAPH graphics research papers and implement awesome stuff.

	<p>
	  In my spare time, I like to dance, read, write, and explore the great outdoors.</p>
	 <p>
	  Let's build great things together.
