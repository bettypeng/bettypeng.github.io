	  Hey there! I'm Betty, a coffee-sipper and senior studying Computer Science and English at Brown University. I love front-end development, computer graphics, and design. I'm interested in learning more about visual computing and the developing fields of virtual and augmented reality.

	  This past summer, I interned at Google with the Play Music team. I implemented entity search suggestions for Music Search, enabling users to play songs and albums directly from the search bar. My current work mainly centers on human-computer interaction with the Brown Graphics Lab Pen and Touch Computing Research group, where we are building a collaborative workspace application that explores the myriad possibilities in the intersection of pen and touch technology, smart desktops, spatial hypermedia systems, and small group collaboration.

	  <strong><a href="about/betty_peng_resume.pdf" target="_blank">Check out my résumé here.</a></strong> In all my work, I'm driven by one thing: making our world a cooler and more beautiful place.
	</p>
	<p>
	  In my spare time, I like to dance, read, write, and explore the great outdoors.</p>
	 <p>
	  Let's build great things together.
